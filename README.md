# Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

In this repository, I will present the personal and group projects I have created during my Master in Business Analytics and Big Data, IE Univeristy.

Following, a brief description of each project you can find in this repository.

## Bike Sharing - Regression Project

In this project, me and my group analysed data related to bike sharing utilisation in Washington DC for the years 2011-2012. The aim of the project was to create a ML Pipeline, from data preparation to data modelling and evaluation, to predict the number of user per day of the bike-sharing service, using weather and time related features as independent variables. The software used for the analysis was Python, especially the library Sklearn. The final result achieved was an R2 of 0.546, using Random Forest Regression.

## CS – GO Prediction - Classification Project

In this project, me and my group analysed data related to hundreds of demos from high level tournament of the popular game Counter Strike – Global Offensive. The aim of the project was to create a ML Pipeline to predict the victory of a round in the game, given many features related to player characteristics (n of previous round won, type of weapons used…). The software used for the analysis was Python, especially the library Sklearn. The final result achieved was an accuracy of 85%, using Random Forest Classifier.

## Food Classification – Computer Vision Project

In this project, I applied Convolutional Neural Networks to predict the probability of an image being a particular type of food. To do so, I created various CNN models to experiment with the different model structures and parameters. The software used for this project is Python, using the Keras library. The best result came from the application of Transfer Learning, achieved through the fine-tuning of a pre-trained model, Inception V3, to get an accuracy of 92%.

## Coca Cola Earnings Prediction - Forecasting Time Series Project

In this project, me and my group applied Forecasting Time Series analysis to predict quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola. We applied several ARIMA models and compared the results obtained. In the end, we achieved a MAPE of 7%. The software used in this analysis was R.

## House Price Prediction – Regression Project

In this project, I applied several regression techniques to predict the price of houses, according to some house characteristics, such as squared meters. The software used for the analysis was R. The final result achieved was a RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error) of 0.25.

## Text Summarisation – NLP Project

In this project, me and my group fine-tuned a Transformer model, called BART, to generate abstractive summaries of legal documents. To do so, we used the “BillSum” dataset, that provides texts of US state bills with their human-generated summaries. In addition, the software used in this project was Python, especially fastai library. Finally, we achieved a ROUGE-1 Score of 51.

## Solar Energy Prediction – Regression Project

In this project, me and my team analysed data related to 98 Solar Energy Stations of Oklahoma, USA. The aim of the project was to predict the amount of energy produced. The software used for this analysis was R.
